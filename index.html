                <h2>Pen & Sword</h2>
                <p>
                    Pen & Sword is a top down 2D hack n' slash meets tower defence style game developed using the Unity 2D game engine. 
                    I was one of three programmers in a team of eight, and focused on mechanics such as player and enemy movement and 
                    combat, as well as environmental interactions. This project is a demo submitted for the DES315 module in my third year 
                    at Abertay University.

                <h2>Unreal Engine Gameplay Mechanic Project</h2>
                <p>
                    For my gameplay mechanic project for the CMP302 module at Abertay, I created a basic 'wallrunning' mechanic 
                    showcased via a short parkour level, as well as featuring other environmental obstacles: water which slows 
                    the player down when walking in it, and gas which damages the player whilst they are within the hitbox.
