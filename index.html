            <h2>Pen & Sword</h2>
            <p>
                Pen & Sword is a top down 2D hack n' slash meets tower defence style game developed using the Unity 2D game engine. 
                I was one of three programmers in a team of eight, and focused on mechanics such as player and enemy movement and 
                combat, as well as environmental interactions. This project is a demo submitted for my DES315 module in my third year 
                at Abertay University.
